# A/B Testing

## A) A/B Testing Application Scenario

A/B testing can be applied to determine the best user interface (UI) for the "Custom Trip Creation" feature. Specifically, we can test different designs and interaction flows to see which version provides a better user experience and leads to a higher completion rate of trip creation.

## B) Versions A and B and A/B Test Execution

### Version A: Simple Interface

- **Design:**

  - Clean and minimalist interface.
  - Clear and direct steps for trip creation: choose starting point, intermediate destinations, and final destination.
  - Progress bar at the top to show which step the user is in.

- **Interaction Flow:**
  - Users select the starting point and final destination on a map.
  - Once selected, users add up to 5 points of interest in a simple list with "Add" buttons.
  - After adding points of interest, the user can review and confirm the route.

### Version B: Interactive Interface

- **Design:**

  - More visual interface with colorful icons for different types of points of interest (restaurants, tourist attractions, etc.).
  - Use of pop-ups and tooltips to provide more information about points of interest during selection.
  - Interactive map that updates the route in real-time as users add new points of interest.

- **Interaction Flow:**
  - Users start by selecting the starting point and final destination on the interactive map.
  - They can click directly on the map to add points of interest, with pop-ups showing details and reviews for each point.
  - The route updates in real-time on the map, showing how each new point of interest affects the route.
  - Users review and confirm the route directly on the interactive map.

### A/B Test Execution

- **User Division:**

  - Users will be randomly divided into two groups: Group A and Group B.
  - Group A will use Version A of the interface, while Group B will use Version B.

- **Test Period:**

  - The test will be conducted over a 4-week period to ensure a statistically significant sample of data.

- **Data Collection:**
  - Data on the completion rate of trip creation, time spent on each step of the process, and the number of points of interest added will be collected and compared between the two groups.

## C) Metrics to be Used

1. **Trip Creation Completion Rate**

   - The percentage of users who start and complete the trip creation process.
   - This metric is crucial to understand which interface leads more users to finalize the trip creation.

2. **Average Time to Completion**

   - The average time users take to complete the trip creation process.
   - This metric helps evaluate the efficiency and intuitiveness of each interface.

3. **Number of Points of Interest Added**

   - The average number of points of interest users add during trip creation.
   - This metric can indicate whether an interface encourages users to explore and personalize their routes more.

4. **Abandonment Rate**

   - The percentage of users who start the trip creation process but abandon it before completion.
   - This metric helps identify potential points of frustration or difficulty in the interfaces.

5. **Qualitative Feedback**
   - User comments and ratings on their experiences with each interface.
   - This metric provides valuable insights into user satisfaction and possible areas for improvement.

## Discussion

Through the analysis of these metrics, it will be possible to identify which version of the interface provides a better user experience and more effectively contributes to creating personalized trips. The version that shows better results in terms of completion rate, average completion time, and the number of points of interest added will be chosen as the preferred interface for the system. Qualitative feedback will also be crucial to understanding nuances that quantitative metrics may not capture.
